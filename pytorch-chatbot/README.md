PyTorch Contextual Chatbot Documentation
Introduction
The PyTorch Contextual Chatbot is a simple yet powerful implementation designed for individuals new to natural language processing and chatbot development. Inspired by an article on contextual chatbots with TensorFlow, this implementation utilizes PyTorch and is easily customizable for various use cases.

Features
Feed Forward Neural Network: The chatbot employs a Feed Forward Neural Network with two hidden layers to understand and respond to user input.

Customization: The implementation allows users to customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the intents.json file, defining tags, patterns, and responses.

Tutorial: A comprehensive tutorial is provided, making it easy for beginners to follow along and gain insights into the underlying concepts.

Variety of Responses: The chatbot offers a variety of responses to different types of questions, ensuring an engaging and dynamic interaction.

Installation
1. Set Up Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment in your project directory:
mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Mac / Linux:
console

. venv/bin/activate
Windows:
console

venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install Dependencies
Install PyTorch and other dependencies:

console
pip install torch
pip install nltk
If you encounter an error during the first run, install nltk.tokenize.punkt:

console

$ python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
Usage
Training
Run the training script to generate the 'data.pth' file:
console
Copy code
python train.py
Chatbot Interaction
Execute the chat script to engage with the chatbot:
console
Copy code
python chat.py
Customization
The intents.json file allows users to customize the chatbot's responses. Each intent consists of a tag, patterns (user input), and responses. Add new intents or modify existing ones to tailor the chatbot to specific requirements. Remember to rerun the training whenever changes are made to the intents.json file.

Example intents.json snippet:

json

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hey", "How are you", "Hello", "Good day"],
      "responses": ["Hey :-)", "Hello, thanks for visiting", "Hi there, what can I do for you?"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Conclusion
The PyTorch Contextual Chatbot offers a foundational understanding of chatbot development and natural language processing.
Its simplicity and customization options make it an ideal starting point for those exploring the exciting field of conversational AI.
The provided tutorial ensures that even beginners can embark on this learning journey with confidence.
